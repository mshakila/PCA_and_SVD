# PCA_and_SVD
Business problem : To do PCA and SVD on wine dataset and then to perform clustering

I have done PCA using R and Python code. Also done calculations and comparisons in excel sheet.
After performing PCA I have done clustering using all 13 variables and used different combos of PCs to find which gives best result

I have done SVD using svd function and Truncated-SVD function. Then compared with PCA and kmeans clustering.
